                            globe, leaving a massive shock for the entire financial markets, especially the banking and
                            real estate industry. The crisis then eroded people’s trust in a centralized and
                            bureaucratic financial system with plenty of vulnerabilities. From this erosion of trust,
                            there came the invention of the blockchain, marking the beginning of a new era in the
                            technological revolution. the venture capital and incubation arm of Binance, has made an
                            investment in the five best-performing projects of Season 5 of its Incubation Program. More
                            than 900 projects applied for participation this season, with less than 2% of them being
                            admitted into the program. The curriculum was tailored to meet founder needs and enhanced
                            with exclusive ecosystem resources and fireside chats with market leaders. "Binance Labs
                            remains dedicated to empowering scalable early-stage projects that contribute to the
                            advancement of the industry. We look forward to seeing the positive impact of Season five’s
                            incubated projects on the broader Web3 ecosystem," said Yibo Ling, Chief Business Officer at
                            Binance. Throughout the incubation process, the Binance Labs team offered 1:1 coaching to
                            help incubation projects build viable products and conducted in-depth assessments to form a
                            final investment decision. The Season 5 cohort had the opportunity to make their pitches to
